# Frameworkless Movement

The Frameworkless Movement is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. We don't hate frameworks, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the **abuse of the use of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt** and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.

## Why the Movement

Everytime that a team is using a framework, it is also taking a **risk**. This risk is, after some time, to be locked up with a tool that is not giving the team any kind of value and that most of the time it represent a major roadblock to change. Most importantly a framework could "die" way before the software that uses it, leaving the developers with a heavy burden.

This risk is amplified without the presence of a strong bond between technical decision making and business goals. We think that every technical decision, including the choice of a framework, should be made considering every aspect of the context the software "lives".

## Our purpose

We commit to learn and help others to learn how to deliver software with a Frameworkless approach. This means to **consider a "No Framework" as an option when choosing a technology** for a new project or a new feature of an existing project. We also want to help everybody to make deliberate tech decisions.

Like we stated before, **we don't think that frameworks are evil**. They are the most powerful tools to learn how to code without them. This because in order to know how and when you should use one particular framework you have to understand how frameworks work. Having clear opportunities and constraints of each framework it will be easier make the right choice, also it will be clear when you don't need a framework. Furthermore understanding how frameworks work behind the scenes will improve your awareness about vanilla javascript. Every framework is written in vanilla javascript and is very generic. Knowing the frameworks rationale you will able to write better specific code. For example a rendering algorithm ad hoc for your application without depending on a framework.


Nevertheless, we think that frameworks should be used responsibly. Remembering that every tool has some kind of tradeoff.

## Principles

These are a draft of the principles that guide us:

* Our primary objective is to deliver quality software in reasonable time. If we can achieve that without frameworks, we prefer to not use them.
* We will commit to understand the code of the framework that we use.
* We will consider non-functional requirements, in order to choose a good framework.
* We will make explicit the reasons, and the tradeoffs, behind every technical decision.

## Be Involved

**We accept any kind of feedback**, so if you want to discuss with us about any of the topics stated here just open an Issue or a Pull Request.

## Our Manifesto

We are going to define and publish the Manifesto of the Movement. **We want to create it sharing our ideas with other developers, so right now we're creating a distributed team to help us to create a good Manifesto**. If you want to be part of this team please send an email to info@frameworklessmovement.org.
